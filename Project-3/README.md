ðŸ§  Inferences Drawn
Employee Demographics:

A majority of the workforce falls within the 30â€“40 years age group, indicating a relatively experienced employee base.

There is a moderate gender diversity, with males forming a higher proportion of the workforce across most departments.

Certain regions (e.g., South and West) have a significantly higher headcount compared to others.

Attrition Trends:

Attrition rates have seen spikes in certain months, aligning with key appraisal or bonus cycles.

Voluntary attrition (resignations) form the majority of exits, suggesting potential areas for improving employee engagement and satisfaction.

Hiring and Recruitment:

Time-to-fill has been improving quarter-over-quarter, indicating streamlined hiring processes.

Some departments consistently report a higher number of open positions, signaling the need for deeper manpower planning.

Performance Distribution:

Most employees are rated as "Meets Expectations," with very few in "Exceeds Expectations" or "Below Expectations," pointing towards a bell-curve performance distribution strategy.

Promotions are primarily concentrated in top-performing business units, correlating with their growth contribution.

Compensation Analysis:

Average salary differences exist between departments, justified partly by functional roles but suggesting a need to monitor equity across similar levels.

Initial signs of gender-based pay disparities at higher grade levels were observed, which could be a future focus area for HR initiatives.

âœ¨ Conclusion
The HR Scorecard Dashboard provides crucial visibility into Glenmark Pharma's workforce dynamics, helping HR teams and leadership proactively address key focus areas like attrition, diversity, performance distribution, and pay equity.
It sets a strong foundation for driving data-backed strategic workforce planning and decision-making.
