Employee KPI Dashboard
Welcome to the Employee KPI Dashboard repository!
This project visualizes key employee performance indicators (KPIs) to help organizations better understand team productivity, identify top performers, and highlight areas for improvement.

üìù Project Overview
The Employee KPI Dashboard is built in Power BI and connects to an Excel dataset containing employee information and performance metrics.
It is designed to:

Track and evaluate employee KPIs

Monitor overall team performance

Identify high-performing and underperforming employees

Enable management to make data-driven HR decisions

üìà What the Dashboard Shows
Performance Trends: See how employee scores evolve over time.

Department-wise Analysis: Compare average scores, salary distributions, and absenteeism across departments.

Top Performers: Identify employees consistently achieving high scores.

At-Risk Employees: Detect employees with low scores or high absenteeism.

Age and Experience Analysis: Study the correlation between age, tenure, and performance.

üîç Key Insights Derived
High absenteeism can be an early warning for disengagement or personal challenges.

High performers often correlate with higher training hours, indicating that training investments could improve KPIs.

Salary vs. Performance trend analysis can help HR optimize compensation structures.

Department-wise productivity differences could guide resource reallocation.

‚úÖ Recommendations
Training Focus: Encourage and invest more in employee training programs, especially for departments with lower performance scores.

Recognition Programs: Create recognition programs for top performers to motivate others.

Absenteeism Strategy: Implement strategies like flexible working or wellness programs to tackle high absenteeism.

Performance-linked Incentives: Adjust salary raises and bonuses to better match KPI outcomes.

Continuous Monitoring: Set up monthly or quarterly reviews to catch performance dips early.
